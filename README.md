Hello! I'm WheatelyTech or WTech! My legal name is Steven, but I like going by WTech.
I'm just a 13 year old idiot just messing around.
I don't know programing or coding much, so I play around, but i am interested in Lua.
Also, I have a YouTube and TikTok. As the time of writing this, I don't post on YouTube,
but i have some videos fresh and ready!

YT: https://www.youtube.com/@wheatelytech
So yeah, look around my repositories if you want to, but I either use it for storage if I don't
want to put it on my iCloud, or if I actually start developing something!
(btw oliver's tech corner my beloved)ðŸ’€
